# FRACTALS

## Descriptions:
This file, when run with GhostScript will generate the following fractals
* triforce (or *Sierpinski gasket* to be precise)
* a box thing I don't know the name of that I had fun with
* a spiral thing I've decided to call "Connor's Pointy Spiral"

## To Run:
To run it in my machine, I reached into the `gswin64c.exe` file in my Windows machine. The full command I used (while in the `\fractals` folder) as:
```bash
 'C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.27\bin\gswin64c.exe' .\fractal.ps
```
