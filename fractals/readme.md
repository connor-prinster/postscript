This file, when run with GhostScript will generate the following fractals
* triforce (or *Sierpinski gasket* to be precise)

To run it in my machine, I reached to the `gswin64c.exe` file in my Windows machine. The full command I used was:
```bash
'C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.27\bin\gswin64c.exe <path to current directory>\fractals.ps
```
