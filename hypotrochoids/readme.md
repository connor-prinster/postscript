This file, when run with GhostScript will generate 10 different hypotrochoids of various colors (most notably: blue, light blue, lighter blue, white, black, and green)

To run it in my machine, I reached to the `gswin64c.exe` file in my Windows machine. The full command I used was:
```bash
'C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.27\bin\gswin64c.exe <path to current directory>\hypotrochoids.ps
```
